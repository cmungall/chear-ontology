This python code uses the Beautiful Soup package to extract codebook values and Semantic Data Dictionary Starting points from NHANES documents.

To specify which year's variables to extract from, set the starting year on the begin_year variable. As 2013-2014 data is the most up to date and complete at the time of this writing, begin_year has been set to 2013.
